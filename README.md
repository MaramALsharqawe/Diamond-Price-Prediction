# Diamond-Price-Prediction

This project is to build a decision tree regression model to predict diamond prices with 96.4% accuracy. The model will use a data set of 43,152 diamonds to figure out the relationship between price and factors such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, depth, and scale. The model can be used to predict the price of new diamonds, which can be useful to jewelers and diamond buyers.
